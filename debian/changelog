  * [021333b] New patch: Reduce stress test lengths to help weak buildds
    (Closes: #902104)
  * [dc825fb] New upstream security release (1.0.4)
    Libqb creates files in world-writable directories (/dev/shm, /tmp) with
    rather predictable file names. Also O_EXCL flag is not used when opening
    the files.  This could be exploited by a local attacker to overwrite
    privileged system files.  (CVE-2019-12779, Closes: #927159)

  * [1fc3d87] Switch to Debhelper compat level 11
  * [930dba8] Combat test failures with a world-writeable socket directory.
    On Linux systems libqb uses abstract sockets by default, which lack
    access control.  However, they aren't available on other platforms.
    The other option is using file system sockets, by default under
    /var/run.  This directory is only writable by root, though, which
    makes it inapproriate for unprivileged applications.  So use /tmp
    instead.
