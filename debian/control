X-Common-Description: libqb provides a set of high performance client-server
 reusable features. It offers high performance logging, tracing, IPC and poll.
 Its initial features were spun off the Corosync cluster communication suite
 to make them accessible for other projects.

Description: generate man pages from Doxygen XML files
 This is a tool to generate API manpages from a doxygen-annotated
 header files. First run doxygen on the header files and then run this
 program against the main XML file it created and the directory
 containing the ancilliary files. It will then output a lot of *.3 man
 page files which you can then ship with your library.
